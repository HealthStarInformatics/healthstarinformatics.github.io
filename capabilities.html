          <h2>Design and Development</h2>
          <p>We are experts in both Greenfield and Brownfield application development. We build applications with a User-Centred Design (UCD) approach rather than a feature-driven approach. Our cross-functional development team works collaboratively to build strategic partnerships from product conceptualization to solution implementation. We develop solutions that support our clients for years to come. Our team delivers fault tolerant applications adhering to industry standard methodologies such as Twelve Factor App, and Reactive Manifesto. Our solutions minimize technical debt, which is essential to keeping the product roadmap flexible and quickly responding to changing requirements. We understand the good and the bad of microservices beyond the hype. </p>

          <h2>Cloud Native</h2>
          <p>Our cloud-native expertise spans across the entire gamut - including microservices architecture, container-based applications, dynamic orchestration of compute, storage, and networking resources. Our cloud-native approach speeds up how our clients build new applications, optimize the existing ones, and connect them all together. We focus on an architectureâ€™s modularity, loose coupling, and the independence of its services to speed up application delivery . Each microservice implements a business capability, runs in its own process, and communicates via application programming interfaces (APIs) or messaging. For legacy apps, optimization is supported by DevOps workflows like continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) and fully automated deployment operations.</p>

          <h2>Data Analytics</h2>
          <p>We are experts at the Big Data Landscape - Infrastructure, Analytics, and Applications. We use open-source, lightning fast, reactive and distributed cluster computing frameworks - Spark, MapReduce, Hadoop, Hive, Kafka, Casandra, ElasticSearch, Akka. - to enable fast and powerful large-scale data processing. To meet the business goals, we provide end-to-end big data expertise starting with the type of analytics to implement (batch, streaming, real-time or offline), what frameworks/language to select, how to achieve the required framework performance, how to integrate different architecture elements (Spark, a database, a streaming processor, etc)., and how to build applications architecture to facilitate code reuse, quality and performance.</p>

          <h2>DevSecOps</h2>
          <p>We think of DevSecOps not just as a collection of tools, but as a holistic process, grounded in the DevOps mindset. Our experts leverage the inherent security benefits of modern cloud platforms to build automated security checkpoints, thus creating unprecedented protection from costly vulnerabilities. We codify testing, monitoring and reporting, embed them in the continuous delivery pipeline to generate fast feedback loops regarding the state of the infrastructure security, across the system.</p>
